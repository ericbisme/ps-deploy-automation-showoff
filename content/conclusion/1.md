#Executive Summary
## What's my ROI on this bad boy
* PeopleTools 8.55.13 patch
  * 14 non-production instances in under 4hrs
  * Production Patch to IB Gateway, IH/FIN/HCM in 1.5hrs
* Post-maintenance checkouts
  * Smoke test time per instance under 2 minutes
* On the road to fully automated spin up of devel instances
* Same process applies to PeopleSoft COBOL and Elasticsearch DPK
